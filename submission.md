title: Submitting Homework
---

You will submit your homework both electronically and by handing in a hard-copy in lecture. 

You will submit your homework electronically via Chalk on or before the due date listed on each homework. See below for a warning on using Chalk.

You will *also* submit a physical print-out of your code at the beginning of the next class. This print-out must be identical to what you turn in on Chalk. We will try to get this print-out graded and back to you quickly with comments.  

Late physical copies will be accepted only in severe circumstances (hospitalization, etc...)

Chalk
-----

To submit homework electronically we will use Chalk. This requires a little bit of care on your part. 

First, be aware that you must both *save* and *submit* your work on Chalk for it to get to the grader. Second, be aware that once you submit you can not resubmit. Submitting is final. Handling individual special-case e-mail submissions takes a surprisingly large amount of time for the grader and will not be allowed. 

So, both save and submit your assignment on chalk but do not submit until it's really done.

If, for whatever reason, you fail to submit your homework on chalk by the due date you should still turn in a physical copy during the next lecture. Your homework will be graded with a maximum score of 70%. 

Homework due dates will be posted on the assignment. They are strict. 

What we're looking for
----------------------

We will look for the following things in roughly this order

 * Does it compile?
 * Does it produce the desired output in the simple cases?
 * Is it well organized? Is it a clean, concise solution or a jumble of code? Intelligently separated into functions or all in one big main()?
 * Is it tested? Have you supplied evidence that your program works
 * Does it follow standard style? (indentation, good variable names, etc...)
 * Is it well tested? Have you supplied evidence that each of the pieces of
 your code work as expected?
 * Does it produce the desired output in the more complex cases?

Tip: Style is actually really important. If your code is easy to read it puts the grader in a good mood. You want your grader to be happy.

Make sure that your code compiles as you write it. A common mistake for first time programmers is to write a large program all at once and then try to fix errors at the end. The result is a program with one hundred errors that is very difficult to debug. It is best to write small pieces of your program one at a time and make them error-free before you continue. 

Your code will be graded on the Maclab machines. Please be sure it compiles and runs there before submitting. There may be slight differences between how the program runs on different computers. If your code runs perfectly on your machine but does not compile on the Maclab computers you will likely receive a low grade.  

Conclusion
----------

Submit a paper and an electronic copy. Beware of Chalk, it's picky. Write good code.
