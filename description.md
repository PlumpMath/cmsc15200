An introduction to computer science using the C and Python programming languages.

We have five weeks to cover a number of challenging subjects. The following schedule is subject to change. 

 * Week 1: Beginning C: Variables (int, double, char), Boolean expressions, Control (if, while, for), Functions.
 * Week 2: Moderate C: Functions, Testing, Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Memory
 * Week 3: Advanced C: Dynamic Memory, Structs, Data structures
 * Week 4: Advanced C / Beginning Python: Lists, Classes
 * Week 5: Advanced Topics: Higher order functions, plotting, algorithms, etc...  Dependent on class interests.

Prerequisites
-------------

This course assumes no prior knowledge of programming or computer science. Some elementary background in Math will be assumed. 

Differences in the Summer
-------------------------

CS 152 in the Summer differs from the course taught in the Fall. The
enrollment in the Summer usually consists of a greater number of non-majors
than normal. As a result this course will spend more time on standard data
analysis tasks and a broad overview of programming paradigms and will spend
less time on systems-related topics, notably advanced data structures. If you wish to continue on to CS-154 you will need to do some work independently to fill in the gaps.
