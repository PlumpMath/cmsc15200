title: Academic Honesty Policy
---

Presenting someone else's work, whether it from a friend, a website, a
textbook, etc, as your own is unacceptable.  If you do not understand
what is allowed for any given assignment, ask, don't assume.  We will
not accept "I did not understand the rules" as an excuse for
academic dishonesty.  A student who fails to follow this policy will
receive an F in the course (students may appeal this decision to the
Dean of Students at the Division of Physical Sciences and request a
disciplinary committee hearing).

Talking with other students about a problem is fine. Writing code together, whether on a computer or on a blackboard is not fine. Each student must write his/her own code.  

Students should include in their code comments with the names of any
collaborators and any sources used to help solve a problem (including
websites).

If you're frustrated by a problem e-mail the listhost or the instructor. 

At a beginning level cheating is very easy to identify. It's not worth the trouble.
