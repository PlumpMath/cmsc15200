Textbook
--------

There are two recommended texts for C. They are both useful but not required. For Python we will use primarily online resources.

*C Programming, a Modern Approach* by K.N. King

*The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

The text by Kernighan and Ritchie is well respected among computer scientists. However it is very concise and may not be the best choice if you need in depth explanations. It is an excellent reference and good for the impatient reader. It is also relatively cheap.

The text by King is much more approachable. He has more explanations and examples. However it is larger and a bit more expensive.

Both are available at the [Seminary Co-op
Bookstore](http://goo.gl/maps/qHRA) and at Amazon. Neither are required but getting one is strongly suggested. Readings will be provided from both as the course progresses so that you can follow along.
