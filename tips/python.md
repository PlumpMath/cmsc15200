Starting the fourth week of class we switch from C to Python. 

Installing Python
-----------------

We strongly suggest installing the [all-in-one package provided by Enthought](http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php/). 
You should install either the 
[academic](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php) 
or 
[free](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php)
versions. The full version costs money. You don't need this.


Reading materials
-----------------

We do not have a recommended text for Python. We can however point you to a number of good websites. 

* [The official Python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)
* [A StackOverflow answer to this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70577/best-online-resource-to-learn-python)
* [An introductory course that uses Python from Google](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/) - This is a smaller course that is well particularly formatted for the web.
* [An introductory course that uses Python on OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/Syllabus/) - This is a complete course with videos and homeworks taught at MIT. 
* [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/) - A more traditional text
