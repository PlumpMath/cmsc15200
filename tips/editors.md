title: Editors

It is easy to make simple mistakes while writing code. This causes frustration.
A good editing environment can help to minimize unnecessary mistakes. In
general you have two choices 

 * A graphical IDE like Eclipse, Visual Studio, or Xcode
 * An advanced text editor like `vim`, `emacs`, Notepad++ or TextMate

In lab we will set you up with Eclipse which is a universally available and
free IDE. You are welcome to use whatever you like. Eclipse is decent in all
respects but commendable in none. 

IDEs
----

IDE stands for integrated development environment. It is a combination of a
text editor, a compiler (like gcc), and a running environment (like the
terminal). In lab we will use Eclipse. You can download and install Eclipse on
your home machine as well [download link](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

Alternatively you may choose a different option. In particular [Visual
Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express)
is an excellent IDE made by Microsoft and available for Windows computers. 

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the equivalent product for Mac
OS-X. 

Text Editors
------------

Linux

On the Maclab machines you have the following options

* Bluefish - easy to use
* gedit - easy to use
* emacs - powerful, some learning required (tutorial built in)
* vim - powerful, some learning required (run vimtutor for tutorial)

Emacs and vim are common enough to be available on all platforms.

Windows
```````

Notepad++ is a well-loved text editor. There are several alternatives. 
[The relevant stackoverflow
discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14155/windows-based-text-editors)
has some good suggestions.

Mac

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
is an excellent editor although it does cost money. There is a 30 day
free trial that may interest you.
