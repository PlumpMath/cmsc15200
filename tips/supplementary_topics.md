If you'd like to know more about low level computer science you could look into
the following topics. These mostly fall into the two categories "unix
utilities" and "data structures"

The Unix toolset

* Standard unix utilities `ls` `cp` `cd`
* More interesting unix utilities. You should go through [a tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
* You should be comfortable with a high quality text editor (emacs, vim). 
* [Standard streams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

[Abstract Data Types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)

* [Stacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28data_structure%29)
* [Queues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28data_structure%29)
* [Trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28computer_science%29)
* [Graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28data_structure%29)
* [Priority Queues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)

[Data Structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structures)
