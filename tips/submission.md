title: Submitting Homework
---

You will submit your homework electronically by
[svn](svn.html) on or before the due date listed on each homework.

Homework due dates will be posted on the assignment. They are strict. 

What we're looking for
----------------------

We will look for the following things in roughly this order

 * Does it compile?
 * Does it produce the desired output in the simple cases?
 * Is it well organized? Is it a clean, concise solution or a jumble of code? Intelligently separated into functions or all in one big main()?
 * Is it tested? Have you supplied evidence that your program works
 * Does it follow standard style? (indentation, good variable names, etc...)
 * Is it well tested? Have you supplied evidence that each of the pieces of
 your code work as expected?
 * Does it produce the desired output in the more complex cases?
 * Is it the simplest possible program that does all of the above?

Tip: Style is actually really important. If your code is easy to read it puts the grader in a good mood. You want your grader to be happy.

What files should you submit?
-----------------------------

We will try to specify exactly what files we're looking for in each assignment.
Please ask for clarification if necessary. 

In general we will never want project files or complex directories produced by
IDEs like Visual Studio/Xcode/Eclipse. We just want raw `.c` files and
occasional text files. If we ask for a textfile this should be submitted in
raw text and not in any complex document format such as MS Word or any other
office suite. For a list of good programs that produce raw text please see the
tip page on [editors](editors.html).

Your code will be graded by calling `gcc` on the Maclab machines. Ideally `C`
code that compiles and runs on one type of computer will compile and run
identically on all types of computers. This is not always the case. If your
code runs perfectly on your machine but does not compile on the Maclab
computers you will likely receive a low grade. This is rare but does happen.
